I have worked closely with Pritesh Patel in the past and can confidently recommend him based on his strong hands-on experience in UAT testing within the banking domain. He has led end-to-end UAT cycles for complex applications, including test strategy, execution, defect management, and coordination with business stakeholders. Pritesh has worked with leading organizations in Canada, including RBC Bank and Capgemini, and brings a solid understanding of banking transactions, data flows, and compliance-driven testing. His experience and professionalism make him a strong fit for this Senior UAT Tester role.

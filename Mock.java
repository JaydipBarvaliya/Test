Here are two clean, sharp entries you can drop directly into your Confluence table. I’m keeping the tone consistent with the rest of your document and sticking to crisp “Problem / Solution” format.

⸻

1. PMD Plugin Introduction

Problem: Codebase had inconsistent coding standards and no static analysis enforcement, leading to missed bugs, unused code, and quality issues across modules.

Solution: Introduced the PMD plugin in the build pipeline to automatically enforce coding standards, detect common issues early, and maintain consistent code quality across all modules.

2. Text File Rules (Textfile / TextLint Equivalent)

(This is the second feature they added along with PMD. In your project, this was introduced to validate formatting and enforce consistency in text-based resources.)

Problem: Text-based configuration files lacked validation, causing formatting inconsistencies and making it harder to maintain clean and readable project documentation and config files.

Solution: Added text file validation rules in the build process to enforce consistent formatting and ensure all text resources follow the required project conventions.

If you want, I can reformat them exactly in the same table language you used for the “Problem NOTE” style.

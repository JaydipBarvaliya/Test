Here is a clean, straight, and professional Problem / Solution pair for the static-method removal and DI migration.

⸻

Replaced Static Method Usage with Dependency Injection

Problem:
Several components relied on static methods, which made the code tightly coupled, hard to test, and incompatible with Spring’s lifecycle and dependency management.

Solution:
Removed static method usage and refactored the code to use Spring-managed beans through dependency injection, improving testability, reducing coupling, and ensuring consistent behavior across the application.

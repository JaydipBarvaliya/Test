I actually run jellyfin in the car. The apps are faster and better. I wish that emby would connect and play music faster like jellyfin does. It's really disappointing when I can see the playlist and songs in emby but it takes 10-15 minutes and several tries to get it streaming. On my home network it works fine. I have tried tailscale which my emby and jellyfin are both on. I have done reverse proxy through nginx and nothing really helps. They're all slow to load songs and start. But jellyfin does fine. I would like a mobile emby music app only. I'm trying the Narjo beta too but it's no better. Say what you will about jellyfin but it does just work. If I hadn't paid for emby I wouldn't be running it. Sure jellyfin doesn't look as nice and the Metadata is jacked up, but it runs fast and on the go.

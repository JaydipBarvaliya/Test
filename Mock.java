Nice — your email is actually really solid: clear, technical, and polite. 👏 But with a few small tweaks, you can make it read more smoothly and sound more professional (less repetitive, slightly tighter grammar, more polished flow).

Here’s a lightly rephrased version that keeps your tone but tightens the writing:

Subject: Query on Spectral 1.3.2 Support for text/plain and binary/octet-stream Media Types

Hi [Name/Team],

I noticed that a new version of spectral.yml (v1.3.2) was released on August 28, 2025, as per the following page:
🔗 Spectral File + Release Notes

Previously, when we validated our OAS Spec file with version 1.3.1, it threw an error stating “Media Type not maintained within TD” for the text/plain and binary/octet-stream media types.

However, with version 1.3.2, no such error appears in Stoplight Studio. When I reviewed the ruleset inside the spectral.yml file for 1.3.2, I didn’t see any explicit inclusion for these media types.

Could you please clarify:
	•	Has Spectral started supporting the text/plain and binary/octet-stream media types?
	•	Did the APIM team approve these media types? If so, can we now consider them fully supported and allowed?

Also, should we run the spec file validation from your side once again?
PFA our latest OAS spec file if you’d like to validate it.

Errors seen in v1.3.1:

Best regards,

🔍 Notes on what I improved:
	•	Removed a few redundancies (“no error shown” → “no such error appears”).
	•	Combined related sentences for smoother flow.
	•	Added small punctuation and capitalization consistency.
	•	Slightly more formal phrasing in questions, but still approachable.

If you want, I can make it more casual or conversational (e.g., for internal team emails) — want me to rewrite it that way too?

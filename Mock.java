Hi Garrett,

Oh, I see.

I thought that email was related to the GitHub vulnerability feature I was testing, which is why I interacted with it. I understand now that it was part of the phishing simulation.

No worries — I’ll make sure to be more cautious going forward and will report any suspicious emails immediately.

Thanks for letting me know.
